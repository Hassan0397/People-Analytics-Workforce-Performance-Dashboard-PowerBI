## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 🟦 1. Data Preparation
Datasets used:

- `dim_employee.csv` → Employee master data  
- `dim_department.csv` → Department reference  
- `dim_date.csv` → Date dimension for time intelligence  
- `fact_performance.csv` → Performance review scores  
- `fact_attendance_monthly.csv` → Monthly attendance & absence  
- `fact_compensation.csv` → Salary & compensation  
- `fact_surveys.csv` → Employee engagement scores  
- `fact_events.csv` → HR-related events  

**Cleaning & Transformation:**

- Converted dates (`HireDate`, `ExitDate`, `BirthDate`) to **Date type**  
- Filled missing values and standardized formats  
- Created derived columns:  
  - `AgeYears`, `TenureYears`, `TenureMonths`, `HireYear`, `ManagerName`, `LastReviewDate`, `DaysSinceLastReview`  
- Numeric columns formatted as **Currency, Decimal, Whole Number**  

---

### 🟩 2. Data Modeling
- Built **star schema** with dimension tables: `dim_employee`, `dim_department`, `dim_date`  
- Fact tables: `fact_performance`, `fact_attendance_monthly`, `fact_compensation`, `fact_surveys`, `fact_events`  
- Linked all facts to `dim_employee` using **EmployeeID**  
- Marked `dim_date` as the **official Date Table**  
- Relationships set as **Many-to-One** from facts to dimensions

### 🟨 3. Core DAX Measures

- **Headcount** → `COUNTROWS(dim_employee)`  
- **New Hires** → Employees with hire date in selected period  
- **Terminations** → Employees with exit date in selected period  
- **Attrition Rate** → `DIVIDE([Terminations], [Headcount], 0)`  
- **Avg Tenure (Years)** → Average of `TenureYears`  
- **Avg Perf Score** → Average performance score  
- **Avg Engagement Score** → Average survey score  
- **Absence Rate** → From attendance data  
- **Total Salary Cost** → Sum of salaries  
- **Median Salary** → Median salary across workforce  
- **Avg Reports per Manager** → Span of control
